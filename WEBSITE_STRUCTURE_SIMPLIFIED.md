# Website Structure Simplification - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Created a clean, neutral, and fully functional website structure focusing on core functionality over complex styling.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. CSS Cleanup
**Before**: Complex CSS with Tailwind v4 syntax, CSS variables, and problematic @apply directives
**After**: Simple, clean CSS with:
- Basic Tailwind integration (@tailwind base/components/utilities)
- Standard CSS for typography, buttons, cards, navigation
- No complex variables or advanced features
- Cross-browser compatible styles

### 2. Homepage Simplification
**Before**: 387-line complex page with animations, AI dialogs, complex state management
**After**: Clean, straightforward homepage with:
- Simple header with navigation
- Hero section with clear value proposition
- Features section (How It Works)
- Stats section
- Call-to-action section
- Footer with organized links
