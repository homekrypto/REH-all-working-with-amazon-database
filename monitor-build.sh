echo "Project: REH Real Estate Platform"
echo "Optimizations Applied: ✅"
echo "========================================"

echo ""
echo "📊 OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY:"
echo "✅ Removed 80+ heavy packages (aws-sdk v2, playwright, puppeteer)"
echo "✅ Optimized amplify.yml with npm ci flags"
echo "✅ Increased Node.js memory to 4GB"
echo "✅ Enabled standalone output for faster deploys"
echo "✅ Streamlined environment variable checks"

echo ""
echo "⏱️ EXPECTED BUILD TIMES:"
echo "Before optimization: ~15-20 minutes"
echo "After optimization:  ~6-8 minutes (50-70% faster)"

echo ""
echo "🔗 MONITORING LINKS:"
echo "- Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/"
echo "- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/homekrypto/REH-all-working-with-amazon-database"

echo ""
echo "📋 BUILD PHASES TO WATCH:"
echo "1. ⏳ Provisioning (1-2 min)"
echo "2. ⏳ PreBuild - npm ci install (~2-3 min, was ~8-10 min)"
echo "3. ⏳ Build - next build (~3-4 min)"
echo "4. ⏳ Post Build - artifacts (~1 min)"
echo "5. ✅ Deploy (~1 min)"

echo ""
echo "🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:"
echo "- npm install taking >5 minutes (should be ~2-3 min now)"
echo "- Memory errors (increased to 4GB)"
echo "- Environment variable missing errors"
echo "- TypeScript/build errors"

echo ""
echo "📈 SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "✅ 'Dependencies installed' appears in ~2-3 minutes"
echo "✅ 'Build completed successfully' appears"
echo "✅ Total time under 10 minutes"
echo "✅ App accessible at Amplify URL"

echo ""
echo "🔄 If build is still slow, check:"
echo "1. AWS region performance"
echo "2. Amplify instance type"
echo "3. Network connectivity to npm registry"

echo ""
echo "⚡ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Monitor current build in Amplify Console"
echo "2. Verify all integrations work in production"
echo "3. Clean up test/debug endpoints after success"
