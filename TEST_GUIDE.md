- **Password**: `test123`
- **Role**: Agent
- **Name**: Test Agent

2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try refreshing the page

### If dashboard doesn't load:
1. Make sure you're logged in first
2. Check that you're being redirected to `/dashboard`
3. Look for loading spinner during authentication

### If you see errors:
