echo "üìã **CURRENT STATUS:**"
echo "‚Ä¢ Build progressed past YAML syntax errors ‚úÖ"
echo "‚Ä¢ Frontend build started successfully ‚úÖ" 
echo "‚Ä¢ NODE_ENV=production detected ‚úÖ"
echo "‚Ä¢ SSM warning is non-fatal (expected) ‚úÖ"
echo ""

echo "üéØ **LIKELY ISSUE:**"
echo "The build logs are getting cut off, but based on previous patterns,"
echo "the environment variables are likely missing in the Amplify Console."
echo ""

echo "üîß **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**"
echo "1. Go to AWS Amplify Console ‚Üí Environment Variables:"
echo "   https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=eu-north-1#/d1ec4l2vmh6hbe/settings/environment"
echo ""
echo "2. Verify these variables are set with actual values (not placeholders):"
echo "   ‚úÖ DATABASE_URL"
echo "   ‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
echo "   ‚úÖ S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
echo "   ‚úÖ S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
echo "   ‚úÖ S3_BUCKET_NAME"
echo "   ‚úÖ S3_REGION"
echo "   ‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"
echo "   ‚úÖ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
echo "   ‚úÖ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
echo "   ‚úÖ STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
echo "   ‚úÖ EMAIL_SERVER"
echo "   ‚úÖ EMAIL_FROM"
echo "   ‚úÖ NEXTAUTH_URL"
echo ""

echo "üö® **CRITICAL:**"
echo "‚Ä¢ DO NOT use 'AWS_' prefixed variables (Amplify blocks them)"
echo "‚Ä¢ USE 'S3_' prefixed variables instead"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ensure DATABASE_URL has URL-encoded password ($ becomes %24)"
echo ""

echo "üìñ **REFERENCE:**"
echo "‚Ä¢ Environment Variables: AMPLIFY_ENV_VARS_UPDATED.txt"
echo "‚Ä¢ Live Site: https://main.d1ec4l2vmh6hbe.amplifyapp.com"

echo "‚ö° **NEXT STEPS:**"
echo "1. Check/update environment variables in Amplify Console"
echo "2. Redeploy the app"
echo "3. Monitor build logs for our environment variable validation output"
