# Dashboard UI Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ 1. Header Covering Dashboard Content
**Problem:** Fixed navigation header was covering the top part of dashboard content
**Solution:** Added `pt-16` (padding-top: 4rem) to all dashboard components:
- `src/components/dashboard/agent-dashboard.tsx` - Line 196
- `src/components/dashboard/user-dashboard.tsx` - Line 154  
- `src/components/dashboard/expert-dashboard.tsx` - Line 76

### ✅ 2. Theme Toggle Not Available on Dashboard
**Problem:** Theme switching was restricted to only homepage and `/agents` pages
**Solution:** Extended theme toggle availability to dashboard pages in `src/components/global-navigation.tsx`:
- Added `/dashboard` to `allowedThemeTogglePages` array
- Added condition to show theme toggle on any path starting with `/dashboard`

### ✅ 3. Create Listing Button Not Working
**Problem:** "Create Listing" button in agent dashboard had no navigation functionality
**Solution:** In `src/components/dashboard/agent-dashboard.tsx`:
- Added `useRouter` import from `next/navigation`
- Added router instance in component function
- Added `onClick={() => router.push('/add-listing')}` to the Create Listing button

### ✅ 4. Removed Upgrade Functionality
**Problem:** User didn't want upgrade modals and buttons throughout the dashboard
**Solution:** Removed all upgrade-related code from dashboard components:

#### Agent Dashboard (`src/components/dashboard/agent-dashboard.tsx`):
- Removed `UpgradeModal` import
- Removed `showUpgradeModal` state variable  
- Removed "Upgrade to Expert" button from header
- Removed "Upgrade Plan" button from subscription card
- Removed `<UpgradeModal>` component at bottom

#### User Dashboard (`src/components/dashboard/user-dashboard.tsx`):
- Removed `UpgradeModal` import
- Removed `showUpgradeModal` state variable
- Removed "Upgrade" button from header
- Removed "Upgrade Now" button from agent promotion card
- Removed `<UpgradeModal>` component at bottom

### ✅ 5. Cleaned Up Debug Code
**Problem:** Console.log statements were left in production code
**Solution:** Removed debug logging from:
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login form debugging statements
- `src/lib/auth-options.ts` - NextAuth authorize function debugging

## File Changes Summary:
