# Platform TODO

## 1) NextAuth (Credentials + Google) with real sessions âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add NextAuth App Router config
  - [x] `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

## 2) Prisma schema for Listings/Leads/Messages + API routes âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add models:
  - [x] Listing(id, agentId, title, description, price, currency, location, geoJson, type, status, publishedAt)
  - [x] ListingImage(id, listingId, url, order)
  - [x] Favorite(userId, listingId, createdAt)
  - [x] Lead(id, userId, agentId, listingId?, status, message, createdAt)

Acceptance: Agents can CRUD listings; users can view listings and create leads; conversations/messages persist via API. âœ…

## 3) Route protection by role âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Roles: User, Agent, AgencyAdmin, Admin (in session)
- [x] Middleware `src/middleware.ts`
  - [x] Redirect unauthenticated from `/dashboard`, `/add-listing`, `/profile`
  - [x] Restrict `/add-listing` to Agent/AgencyAdmin/Admin

  - [x] Email validation and duplicate checking
  - [x] Password hashing with bcrypt
  - [x] User creation with proper role assignment

  - [x] Reset token generation (logged for dev)
  - [x] Email simulation (console logging)
- [x] Complete Auth UI Flow
  - [x] Registration dialog component (`src/components/auth/register.tsx`)
  - [x] Forgot password dialog component (`src/components/auth/forgot-password.tsx`)
  - [x] Updated login component with navigation to both
  - [x] Integrated all dialogs in main page with proper state management

- [x] On send: store Message, emit to room
- [x] Client hook + minimal chat UI in dashboard
- [x] JWT token generation endpoint for Socket.IO authentication
- [x] Database persistence for messages and conversations
- [x] Participant verification and access control
- [x] Real-time typing indicators and read receipts
- [x] Seed script for test conversation data

Acceptance: Only authenticated users connect; messages are real-time and persisted; history loads on refresh. âœ…

## Supporting âœ… COMPLETED
