echo "==========================================="

echo ""
echo "üìä CURRENT PROJECT ANALYSIS:"
echo "- Dependencies: $(jq '.dependencies | length' package.json) production packages"
echo "- DevDependencies: $(jq '.devDependencies | length' package.json) dev packages"

echo ""
echo "üîç POTENTIAL BUILD BOTTLENECKS:"
echo "1. Large dependency count ($(jq '.dependencies | length' package.json) + $(jq '.devDependencies | length' package.json) = $(($(jq '.dependencies | length' package.json) + $(jq '.devDependencies | length' package.json))) total)"
echo "2. Heavy packages detected:"
grep -E '"(playwright|puppeteer|aws-sdk|@aws-sdk|prisma)"' package.json | sed 's/^/   - /'

echo ""
echo "‚ö° OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:"
echo "1. Use optimized amplify.yml (amplify-optimized.yml created)"
echo "2. Consider moving heavy packages to devDependencies if not needed in production"
echo "3. Enable build caching more aggressively"

echo ""
echo "üîß QUICK FIXES TO APPLY:"
echo "1. Replace current amplify.yml with optimized version:"
echo "   cp amplify-optimized.yml amplify.yml"
echo ""
echo "2. Remove unused heavy dependencies:"
echo "   - playwright (if not used in production)"
echo "   - puppeteer (if not used in production)"
echo "   - aws-sdk (redundant with @aws-sdk packages)"
echo ""
echo "3. Set Node.js memory limit in amplify.yml"
echo "4. Use npm ci with optimizations"

echo ""
echo "üìà MONITORING COMMANDS:"
echo "- Check Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/"
echo "- Monitor build logs for slow steps"
echo "- Look for memory issues or package install delays"

echo ""
echo "üéØ TARGET BUILD TIME: < 10 minutes"
echo "Current average: ~15-20 minutes (needs optimization)"
