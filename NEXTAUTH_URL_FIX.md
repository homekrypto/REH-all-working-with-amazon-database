# üîß NEXTAUTH_URL Trailing Slash Fix

## Issue Found:
In your AWS Amplify environment variables, I noticed:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://main.d1ec4l2vmh6hbe.amplifyapp.com/
```

## Problem:
The trailing slash (`/`) can cause NextAuth.js authentication issues.

## Solution:
Update the environment variable to:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://main.d1ec4l2vmh6hbe.amplifyapp.com
```
(Remove the trailing slash)

## How to Fix:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/d1ec4l2vmh6hbe/settings/variables
2. Find `NEXTAUTH_URL` 
3. Click "Edit"
4. Remove the trailing `/` so it becomes: `https://main.d1ec4l2vmh6hbe.amplifyapp.com`
5. Click "Save"

## Note:
- Our code already handles this automatically with a trailing slash fix
- But it's better to have the correct value in the environment variable
- This fix can be applied after the current deployment completes
- Not critical since we have the code-level fix in place

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Code-level fix applied (strips trailing slash automatically)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Environment variable fix recommended (optional improvement)
